# RECAN

the script simgen.py is useful to test DNA sequences for recombination events. This script creates the same plots as the RAT tool[1] and simplot[2]. The script uses simple pairwise distance between two sequences. Potential recombination event appears as a typical crossover between the two distances of the parental sequences.
The script was tested by using the alignment of recombinant lumpy skin disease virus genomes (about 150000 bp long).
