abstract = {The development of an effective human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine is likely to depend on knowledge of circulating variants of genes other than the commonly sequenced gag and env genes. In addition, full-genome data are particularly limited for HIV-1 subtype C, currently the most commonly transmitted subtype in India and worldwide. Likewise, little is known about sequence variation of HIV-1 in India, the country facing the largest burden of HIV worldwide. Therefore, the objective of this study was to clone and characterize the complete genome of HIV-1 from seroconverters infected with subtype C variants in India. Cocultured HIV-1 isolates were obtained from six seroincident individuals from Pune, India, and virtually full-length HIV-1 genomes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced from each. Sequence analysis revealed that five of the six genomes were of subtype C, while one was a mosaic of subtypes A and C, with multiple breakpoints in env, nef, and the 3' long terminal repeat as determined by both maximal chi2 analysis and phylogenetic bootstrapping. Sequences were compared for preservation of known cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes. Compared with those of the HIV-1LAI sequence, 38{\%} of well-defined CTL epitopes were identical. The proportion of nonconservative substitutions for Env, at 61{\%}, was higher (P {\textless} 0.001) than those for Gag (24{\%}), Pol (18{\%}), and Nef (32{\%}). Therefore, characterized CTL epitopes demonstrated substantial differences from subtype B laboratory strains, which were most pronounced in Env. Because these clones were obtained from Indian seroconverters, they are likely to facilitate vaccine-related efforts in India by providing potential antigens for vaccine candidates as well as for assays of vaccine responsiveness.},

abstract = {RDP4 is the latest version of recombination detection program(RDP), a Windows computer program that implements an extensive array of methods for detecting and visualising recombination in, and stripping evidence of recombination from, virus genome sequence alignments. RDP4 is capable of analysing twice as many sequences (up to 2,500) that are up to three times longer (up to 10Mb) than those that could be analysed by older versions of the program. RDP4 is therefore also appli- cable to the analysis of bacterial full-genome sequence datasets. Other novelties in RDP4 include (1) the capacity to differen- tiate between recombination and genome segment reassortment, (2) the estimation of recombination breakpoint confi- dence intervals, (3) a variety of â€˜recombination aware' phylogenetic tree construction and comparison tools, (4) new matrix- based visualisation tools for examining both individual recombination events and the overall phylogenetic impacts of mul- tiple recombination events and (5) new tests to detect the influences of gene arrangements, encoded protein structure, nucleic acid secondary structure, nucleotide composition, and nucleotide diversity on recombination breakpoint patterns. The key feature of RDP4 that differentiates it from other recombination detection tools is its flexibility. It can be run either in fully automated mode from the command line interface or with a graphically rich user interface that enables detailed exploration of both individual recombination events and overall recombination patterns},

@article{Katoh2002,
abstract = {A multiple sequence alignment program, MAFFT, has been developed. The CPU time is drastically reduced as compared with existing methods. MAFFT includes two novel techniques. (i) Homo logous regions are rapidly identified by the fast Fourier transform (FFT), in which an amino acid sequence is converted to a sequence composed of volume and polarity values of each amino acid residue. (ii) We propose a simplified scoring system that performs well for reducing CPU time and increasing the accuracy of alignments even for sequences having large insertions or extensions as well as distantly related sequences of similar length. Two different heuristics, the progressive method (FFT-NS-2) and the iterative refinement method (FFT-NS-i), are implemented in MAFFT. The performances of FFT-NS-2 and FFT-NS-i were compared with other methods by computer simulations and benchmark tests; the CPU time of FFT-NS-2 is drastically reduced as compared with CLUSTALW with comparable accuracy. FFT-NS-i is over 100 times faster than T-COFFEE, when the number of input sequences exceeds 60, without sacrificing the accuracy.},

abstract = {In the former Soviet Union (SU) increasing numbers of HIV-1 infections among injecting drug users (IDU) have been reported, especially in the Ukraine. The main subtype transmitted among the IDUs seems to be subtype A, but limited numbers of subtype B cases have also been reported. In Kaliningrad, Russia, an AB recombinant strain was earlier shown to be responsible for the local outbreak. Here we describe the genetic relationship of HIV-1 strains circulating among IDUs in the former SU. For subtype A and the AB recombinant strains nearly full-length genomes were sequenced, and for one subtype B strain the entire envelope gene was cloned. The relationship between the AB recombinant strain and the subtype A and subtype B strains and the mosaic structure of the recombinant was studied by phylogenetic analysis. Ukrainian A and B strains were shown to be the probable parental viruses of the Kaliningrad AB recombinant strain. In the envelope gene the recombination breakpoint could also be precisely mapped to a region of similarity of only 14 base pairs. This suggests that only short stretches of absolute sequence identity may be needed for efficient RNA recombination between HIV-1 subtypes.},

@article{Smith2014,
abstract = {UNLABELLED: The 2005 consensus proposal for the classification of hepatitis C virus (HCV) presented an agreed and uniform nomenclature for HCV variants and the criteria for their assignment into genotypes and subtypes. Since its publication, the available dataset of HCV sequences has vastly expanded through advancement in nucleotide sequencing technologies and an increasing focus on the role of HCV genetic variation in disease and treatment outcomes. The current study represents a major update to the previous consensus HCV classification, incorporating additional sequence information derived from over 1,300 (near-)complete genome sequences of HCV available on public databases in May 2013. Analysis resolved several nomenclature conflicts between genotype designations and using consensus criteria created a classification of HCV into seven confirmed genotypes and 67 subtypes. There are 21 additional complete coding region sequences of unassigned subtype. The study additionally describes the development of a Web resource hosted by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) that maintains and regularly updates tables of reference isolates, accession numbers, and annotated alignments (http://talk.ictvonline.org/links/hcv/hcv-classification.htm). The Flaviviridae Study Group urges those who need to check or propose new genotypes or subtypes of HCV to contact the Study Group in advance of publication to avoid nomenclature conflicts appearing in the literature. While the criteria for assigning genotypes and subtypes remain unchanged from previous consensus proposals, changes are proposed in the assignment of provisional subtypes, subtype numbering beyond "w," and the nomenclature of intergenotypic recombinant.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This study represents an important reference point for the consensus classification of HCV variants that will be of value to researchers working in clinical and basic science fields.},

abstract = {Recombination is a pervasive process generating diversity in most viruses. It joins variants that arise independently within the same molecule, creating new opportunities for viruses to overcome selective pressures and to adapt to new environments and hosts. Consequently, the analysis of viral recombination attracts the interest of clinicians, epidemiologists, molecular biologists and evolutionary biologists. In this review we present an overview of three major areas related to viral recombination: (i) the molecular mechanisms that underlie recombination in model viruses, including DNA-viruses (Herpesvirus) and RNA-viruses (Human Influenza Virus and Human Immunodeficiency Virus), (ii) the analytical procedures to detect recombination in viral sequences and to determine the recombination breakpoints, along with the conceptual and methodological tools currently used and a brief overview of the impact of new sequencing technologies on the detection of recombination, and (iii) the major areas in the evolutionary analysis of viral populations on which recombination has an impact. These include the evaluation of selective pressures acting on viral populations, the application of evolutionary reconstructions in the characterization of centralized genes for vaccine design, and the evaluation of linkage disequilibrium and population structure.},

abstract = {We identified a Norwalk-like calicivirus (CV) whose genome likely was derived from naturally occurring recombination. This strain (Arg320) was detected by the EIA developed against recombinant Mexico virus (rMxV) capsids, but the viral RNA polymerase sequence was closer to Lordsdale virus, in a separate genetic cluster of Norwalk-like viruses. A 3.3 kb cDNA from the RNA polymerase region to the 3' end of the genome of Arg320 was cloned and sequenced. The sequence demonstrated that the capsid region of Arg320 shared 95{\%} amino acid identity with MxV, but 68{\%} identity with Lordsdale virus, while the RNA polymerase region shared 95{\%} identity with Lordsdale virus, but 87{\%} identity with MxV. Pair-wise sequence comparisons identified a potential recombination site at the polymerase/capsid junction. This is the first example of a naturally occurring recombinant in the CV family. Further studies to search for and characterize other strains may be necessary for understanding the genetic diversity of the family.},
